**Setup Elk (Elasticsearch and Kibana) Ubuntu**

# Download and install the public signing key:

```
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg

```

# Installing from the APT repository

You may need to install the apt-transport-https package on Debian before proceeding:

```
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
```

Save the repository definition to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list:

```
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list

```

You can install the Elasticsearch Debian package with:

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch
```

# Start Elasticsearch with security enabled

When installing Elasticsearch, security features are enabled and configured by default. When you install Elasticsearch, the following security configuration occurs automatically:

Authentication and authorization are enabled, and a password is generated for the elastic built-in superuser.
Certificates and keys for TLS are generated for the transport and HTTP layer, and TLS is enabled and configured with these keys and certificates.
The password and certificate and keys are output to your terminal.

We recommend storing the elastic password as an environment variable in your shell. Example:


# Running Elasticsearch with systemd

To configure Elasticsearch to start automatically when the system boots up, run the following commands:

```
sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
sudo /bin/systemctl enable elasticsearch.service

```

Elasticsearch can be started and stopped as follows:


```
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch.service

```

# Check that Elasticsearch is running

You can test that your Elasticsearch node is running by sending an HTTPS request to port 9200 on localhost:

```
sudo curl --cacert /etc/elasticsearch/certs/http_ca.crt -u elastic:q0FDkykKZzpE+twj0Iyo https://localhost:9200 
```

The call returns a response like this:

```
{
  "name" : "ip-172-31-58-251",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "YM6WEV9xQJiag-jXiT6JWQ",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "8.12.1",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "deb",
    "build_hash" : "6185ba65d27469afabc9bc951cded6c17c21e3f3",
    "build_date" : "2024-02-01T13:07:13.727175297Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.9.2",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "7.17.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}

```


**Setup Kibana on Ubuntu**


Download and install the public signing key:

```
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg

```

# Install from the APT repository

You may need to install the apt-transport-https package on Debian before proceeding:

```
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
```

Save the repository definition to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list:

```
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
```

You can install the Kibana Debian package with:

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kibana

```

Run Kibana with systemdedit

To configure Kibana to start automatically when the system starts, run the following commands:

```
sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
sudo /bin/systemctl enable kibana.service

```

Kibana loads its configuration from the /etc/kibana/kibana.yml file by default

Update URL, port number and Elasticsearch URL 

After updating the kibana.yml, restart the Kibana

Access the application --

http://<kibana url>:5601/

To generate the Kibana enrollment key 

```
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana

```

**Data Visualization with Kibana**

1. Traffic Volume Over Time:

Purpose: To monitor the number of requests over time. This can help identify trends, peak usage times, and potential DDoS attacks.
Visualization Type: Line chart or Area chart showing the count of requests over time.

2. Response Status Codes Distribution:

Purpose: To understand the distribution of HTTP response status codes (e.g., 200, 404, 500). This helps in identifying errors, broken links, or issues that might be affecting user experience.
Visualization Type: Pie chart or Bar chart showing the percentage or count of each status code.

3. Top Requested URLs:

Purpose: To identify the most accessed URLs. This helps in understanding user behavior and identifying popular content or potential bottlenecks.
Visualization Type: Bar chart showing the top URLs by request count.

4. IP Address Analysis:

Purpose: To identify the top source IP addresses making requests. This can be useful for spotting potential security threats or geographic analysis of your users.
Visualization Type: Table or Bar chart showing the top IP addresses by count of requests.

5. Average Response Time:

Purpose: To monitor the average response time of your web server. This helps in identifying performance issues.
Visualization Type: Line chart showing the average response time over time.

6. Bandwidth Usage:

Purpose: To monitor the amount of data being transferred. This can help in capacity planning and identifying potential DDoS attacks.
Visualization Type: Area chart showing the amount of data transferred over time.

7. User Agents:

Purpose: To analyze the distribution of user agents accessing your application. This can provide insights into the types of devices and browsers your users are using.
Visualization Type: Bar chart or Pie chart showing the distribution of user agents.

8. 404 Errors Analysis:

Purpose: To specifically monitor and analyze requests that result in a 404 Not Found status. This can help in identifying broken links or areas of your site that users are trying to access but don't exist.
Visualization Type: Bar chart showing the top URLs resulting in 404 status, over time or as a total count.

9. Geographical Distribution of Access:

Purpose: To visualize the geographical distribution of your users. This can help in understanding your user base better and in planning server locations.
Visualization Type: Map showing the geographical distribution of requests.

10. Time Taken to Serve Requests:

Purpose: To analyze the time taken to serve requests. This helps in identifying slow responses and potential performance bottlenecks.
Visualization Type: Histogram or Line chart showing the distribution or average of request serving time.
